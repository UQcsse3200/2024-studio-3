## **Course Description**

This game was developed in 8 weeks, with work being broken up into 4 2-week-long sprints. The goals for each sprint were as follows:

- Sprint 1: Minimum viable product
- Sprint 2: Core game functionality
- Sprint 3: Full game delivery
- Sprint 4: Polished game

To better manage these sprints and the features introduced in them, students documented their work in this GitHub repository through pull requests and issues.
